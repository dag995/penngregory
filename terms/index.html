            <h2>3. What is Personal Data?</h2>

            <p>Personal data is, in simple terms, any information about you which enables you to be identified. Personal data covers obvious information such as your name and contact details, but it also covers less obvious information such as identification numbers, electronic location data, and other online identifiers.</p>
            <p>The personal data that we use is set out in clause 5, below.</p>

            <h2>4. What Are My Rights?</h2>

              <li>the right to access the personal data we hold about you;</li>
              <li>the right to have your personal data rectified if any of it held by us is inaccurate or incomplete;</li>
              <li>the right to be forgotten, i.e. the right to ask us to delete any of your personal data that we hold;</li>
              <li>the right to restrict the processing of your personal data;</li>
              <li>the right to object to us using your personal data for a particular purpose.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For more information about our use of your personal data or exercising your rights as outlined above, please contact us using the details provided in clause</p>
            <p>Further information about your rights can also be obtained from the Information Commissioner's Office or your local Citizens Advice Bureau.</p>

            <h2>6. How Do You Use My Personal Data?</h2>
            <p>Under the GDPR, we must always have a lawful basis for using personal data. This may either be because the data is necessary for the performance of our obligations to you, or because you have consented to our use of your personal data, or because it is in our legitimate business interests to use it. Your personal data will be used for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>managing your account;</li>
              <li>supplying our products and services to you;</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>7. How Long Will You Keep My Personal Data?</h2>
            <p>Where we have entered into an agreement to supply products and/or services to you, we shall retain your personal data for a period of seven years from the date of the last supply, in order that we are able to comply with our legal obligations to HM Revenue & Customs.</p>

            <h2>8. How and Where Do You Store or Transfer My Personal Data?</h2>
            <p>We will only store or transfer your personal data within member states of the European Union. This means that your personal data will be fully protected under the GDPR.</p>

            <h2>9. Do You Share My Personal Data?</h2>
            <p>We will not share any of your personal data with any third parties except strictly for the purpose of processing your order and taking payment for the supply of goods and/or services.</p>
            <p>In some limited circumstances, we may be legally required to share certain personal data, which might include yours, if we are involved in legal proceedings or complying with legal obligations, a court order, or the instructions of a government authority.</p>

            <h2>10. How Can I Access My Personal Data?</h2>
            <p>If you wish to know what personal data we hold about you, you can ask us for details of that data and for a copy of it.</p>
